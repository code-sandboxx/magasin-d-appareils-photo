## Pro-Photo: A React-based Camera Shop Simulation with Live and Static Data Options

This project, Pro-Photo, is a camera shop simulation developed using React. It serves as a tool for understanding the operations of an online store and exploring how to manipulate data within the application. 

*Pro-Photo comes in two versions: Static Data Version and Live Data Version (JSON Server).*

 **This is the Static Data Version:** 
 
 In this variant, the application holds product data in a local variable and showcases six products on the catalogue page. Users can add, delete, and modify existing product entries using dedicated buttons and a form. However, these changes do not persist across page reloads.
